* To run the code locally make sure you have the Azure Storage Emulator installed, otherwise you can create a Function App in Azure (with an actual storage account), deploy and run from there. There is no other dependancy (i included my local settings since it doesn't have any connectionstring/keys, this makes it easier to get you started). https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator
* The code is a slightly modified version of the MS Code here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-create-first-csharp?pivots=code-editor-visualstudio. To get more samples (or different programming languages) check out the 'Tutorials' section of the Durable Functions main page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-sequence?tabs=csharp
